    <p>Thanks for the interest in knowing me.
       I'm Kabil Raj, born in Pondicherry and grew up in Chennai, India.
       I am a passionate Electrical Engineer, working now for one of the
       top IT companies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My story of falling in love with the Gaming industry is short, I
      happened to organize a conference for my college and I had the
      opportunity to modify an existing game into something else. I
      used the Unity game engine. Not really much, but that opened
      up a new door to my imagination on what I can do with it.
      I then explored Blender and I got even more curious. And
      since then, I started chasing this newly found passion of
      mine, taking courses in 3d modelling, getting my hands dirty
      by making random 3d models which you can see on the page.
      I love to experiment with 3D modelling, texturing, lighting,
      rendering, which I keep doing now and I hope to do more of it,
      more frequently.</p>
